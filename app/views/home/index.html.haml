          If you are looking at this message it means that you are interested in working with us at #{link_to("GROUNDFLOOR", "https://www.groundfloor.us")}.  If that's not the case you are seriously in the wrong place!!  
        
        %p
          The goal of this sample project is to help both of us get to know each other a little better by actually doing some work.   This project was built in the same way we have built the GROUNDFLOOR website.  So as you look around and get into the code base you will start to get a sense of how we work. Of course through your fixes, additions and commits we start to get a sense of how you work.  
        
        %p
          Make sense?   Cool, lets get started.

        %h1="About This Application"
        %p
          This sample application is very close to the first version of our website.   When we started GROUNDFLOOR we need to attract developers and their projects.  To build our funnel we created a simple little application that allowed developers to sign up and tell us something about the project they wanted to raise funds for. The goals for our original website were simple and straight forward.   The sample application you are working on is designed to mimic those simple goals.

          Website Goals:
          %ul.padded_list
            %li
              %p="Developers need the ability to create and maintain a GROUNDFLOOR account."
            %li
              %p="We need to collect some information about the developer as part of the sign up process."
            %li
              %p="Developers should be able to submit a project through the website and get feedback on wether or not it meets our funding criteria."
            %li
              %p="Projects that match out criteria should then be displayed on the investments page."
        %p
          Thank you for your interest in working with us here at GROUNDFLOOR and look forward to speaking with you.
